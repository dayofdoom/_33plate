# _33plate

This is the plate for the [_33 Keyboard Rev2 by tominabox](https://github.com/tominabox1/_33-Keyboard). I extracted the plate out of the original gerber files. It's missing the decoration and credit present on the FR4 design.

I've cut this plate in 1.5mm POM and verified it works with the 3d printed v2 case by P3D.
